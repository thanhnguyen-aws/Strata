The Laurel language is supposed to serve as an intermediate verification language for at least Java, Python, JavaScript.

It enables doing various forms of verification:
- Deductive verification
- Property based testing
- Data-flow analysis

Features currently not present:
- Type inference. The source program needs to specify enough types so that no inference is needed.
- Type checking. We assume types have already been checked before.
- Namespaces. All definition and reference names consist of a single Identifier

Design choices:
- Pure contracts: contracts may only contain pure code. Pure code does not modify the heap, neither by modifying existing objects are creating new ones.
- Callables: instead of functions and methods we have a single more general concept called a 'callable'.
- Purity: Callables can be marked as pure or impure. Pure callables have a reads clause while impure ones have a modifies clause.
  A reads clause is currently not useful for impure callables, since reads clauses are used to determine when the output changes, but impure callables can be non-determinismic so the output can always change.
- Opacity: callables can have a body that's transparant or opaque. Only an opaque body may declare a postcondition. A transparant callable must be pure.
- StmtExpr: Statements and expressions are part of the same type. This reduces duplication since the same concepts are needed in both, such as conditions and variable declarations.
- Loops: The only loop is a while, but this can be used to compile do-while and for loops to as well.
- Jumps: Instead of break and continue statements, there is a labelled block that can be exited from using an exit statement inside of it.
  This can be used to model break statements and continue statements for both while and for loops.

- User defined types consist of two categories: composite types and constrained types.
- Composite types have fields and callables, and may extend other composite types.
  - Fields state whether they are mutable, which impacts what permissions are needed to access them
  - Fields state their type, which is needed to know the resulting type when reading a field.
- Constrained types are defined by a base type and a constraint over that type.
  - Algebraic datatypes do not exist directly but can be encoded using composite and constrained types.

- For now there is no type polymorphism

- Construction of composite types is WIP. It needs a design first.

A StmtExpr contains both constructs that we typically find in statements and those in expressions.
By using a single datatype we prevent duplication of constructs that can be used in both contexts,
such a conditionals and variable declarations
-/
/-
It would be nice to replace `Type` on the next line with `(isPure: Bool) -> Type`,
so that we can prevent certain constructors from being used for pure StmtExpr's,
but when trying that Lean complained about parameters being used in a nested inductive,
for example in `Option (StmtExpr isPure)`

ProveBy allows writing proof trees. Its semantics are the same as that of the given `value`,
but the `proof` is used to help prove any assertions in `value`.
Example:
ProveBy(
  someCall(arg1, arg2),
  ProveBy(
    aLemmaToHelpProveThePreconditionOfTheCall(),
    anotherLemmaToProveThePreconditionOfTheFirstLemma()
  )
)

-- ContractOf allows extracting the contract of a function
  | ContractOf (type: ContractType) (function: StmtExpr)
/-
Abstract can be used as the root expr in a contract for reads/modifies/precondition/postcondition. For example: `reads(abstract)`
It can only be used for instance callables and it makes the containing type abstract, meaning it can not be instantiated.
An extending type can become concrete by redefining any callables that had abstracts contracts and providing non-abstract contracts.
-/
  | Abstract
  | All -- All refers to all objects in the heap. Can be used in a reads or modifies clause

Note that there are no explicit 'inductive datatypes'. Typed unions are created by
creating a CompositeType for each constructor, and a ConstrainedType for their union.

Example 1:
`composite Some<T> { value: T }`
`constrained Option<T> = value: Dynamic | value is Some<T> || value is Unit`

Example 2:
`composite Cons<T> { head: T, tail: List<T> }`
`constrained List<T> = value: Dynamic | value is Cons<T> || value is Unit`
