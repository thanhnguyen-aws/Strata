# Strata documents created in Verso

This Verso package provides documentation of the core Strata language
and the Dialect Definition Mechanism (DDM). The documentation can be
generated by the command

```
./generate.sh
```

The output will be written to `_out/{document name}`. Links in Verso
documentation do not work if the file is opened in the browser directly.
Instead, we recommend launching a local web server to view the
documentation. If Python is available, then this can be done with the
command

```
python3 -m http.server 1080 -d _out/langdef/html-single
```

or

```
python3 -m http.server 1080 -d _out/ddm/html-single
```

This will print out a URL that can be opened in a browser to view the documentation.

# Strata Language Definition

TODO

# DDM User Manual

New Strata dialects are defined in their own domain-specific language
that can be embededed in Lean or imported from external files. This
document provides a guide to using that DSL.
