# Introduction

Laurel is an intermediate verification language designed to serve as a target for popular
garbage-collected languages that include imperative features, such as Java, Python, and
JavaScript. Laurel tries to include any features that are common to those three languages.

Laurel enables doing various forms of verification:
- Deductive verification
- (WIP) Model checking
- (WIP) Property based testing
- (WIP) Data-flow analysis

Here are some Laurel language features that are shared between the source languages:
- Statements such as loops and return statements
- Mutation of variables, including in expressions
- Reading and writing of fields of references
- Object oriented concepts such as inheritance, type checking, up and down casting and
  dynamic dispatch
- (WIP) Error handling via exceptions
- (WIP) Higher-order procedures and procedure types
- (WIP) Parametric polymorphism

On top of the above features, Laurel adds features that are useful specifically for verification:
- Assert and assume statements
- Loop invariants
- Pre and postconditions for procedures
- Modifies and reads clauses for procedures
- (WIP) Decreases clauses for procedures and loops
- (WIP) Immutable fields and constructors that support assigning to them
- (WIP) Constrained types
- (WIP) Type invariants
- Forall and exists expressions
- (WIP) Old and fresh expressions
- Unbounded integer and real types
- To be designed constructs for supporting proof writing

A peculiar choice of Laurel is that it does not require imperative code to be encapsulated
using a functional specification. A reason for this is that sometimes the imperative code is
as readable as the functional specification. For example:
```
procedure increment(counter: Counter)
  // In Laurel, this ensures clause can be left out
  ensures counter.value == old(counter.value) + 1
{
  counter.value := counter.value + 1;
}
```

## Implementation Choices

A design choice that impacts the implementation of Laurel is that statements and expressions
share a single implementation type, the StmtExpr. This reduces duplication for constructs
like conditionals and variable declarations. Each StmtExpr has a user facing type, which for
statement-like constructs could be void.

# Types

Laurel's type system includes primitive types, collection types, and user-defined types.

## Primitive Types

{docstring Strata.Laurel.HighType}

## User-Defined Types

User-defined types come in two categories: composite types and constrained types.

Composite types have fields and procedures, and may extend other composite types. Fields
declare whether they are mutable and specify their type.

{docstring Strata.Laurel.CompositeType}

{docstring Strata.Laurel.Field}

Constrained types are defined by a base type and a constraint over the values of the base
type. Algebraic datatypes can be encoded using composite and constrained types.

# Expressions and Statements

Laurel uses a unified `StmtExpr` type that contains both expression-like and statement-like
constructs. This avoids duplication of shared concepts such as conditionals and variable
declarations.

## Operations

## The StmtExpr Type

## Metadata

All AST nodes can carry metadata via the `WithMetadata` wrapper.

{docstring Strata.Laurel.WithMetadata}

# Procedures

Procedures are the main unit of specification and verification in Laurel.

{docstring Strata.Laurel.Procedure}

{docstring Strata.Laurel.Parameter}

{docstring Strata.Laurel.Determinism}

{docstring Strata.Laurel.Body}

# Programs

A Laurel program consists of procedures, global variables, type definitions, and constants.

{docstring Strata.Laurel.Program}

# Translation Pipeline

Laurel programs are verified by translating them to Strata Core and then invoking the Core
verification pipeline. The translation involves several passes, each transforming the Laurel
program before the final conversion to Core.

## Heap Parameterization

The heap parameterization pass transforms procedures that interact with the heap by adding
explicit heap parameters. The heap is modeled as `Map Composite (Map Field Box)`, where
`Box` is a tagged union with constructors for each primitive type.

Procedures that write the heap receive both an input and output heap parameter. Procedures
that only read the heap receive an input heap parameter. Field reads and writes are rewritten
to use `readField` and `updateField` functions.

## Modifies Clauses

The modifies clause transformation translates modifies clauses into additional ensures
clauses. The modifies clause of a procedure is translated into a quantified assertion that
states that objects not mentioned in the modifies clause have their field values preserved
between the input and output heap.

## Lifting Expression Assignments

The expression assignment lifting pass transforms assignments that appear in expression
contexts into preceding statements. This is necessary because Strata Core does not support
assignments within expressions.

## Translation to Core

The final translation converts Laurel types, expressions, statements, and procedures into
their Strata Core equivalents. Procedures with bodies that only have constructs supported by
Core expressions are translated to a Core function, while other procedures become Core
procedures.

## Core Prelude

The Laurel translator prepends a Core prelude that defines the heap model types and
operations: `Composite`, `Field`, `Box`, `readField`, and `updateField`.
